Loops in java help us execute a piece of code again and and again.

 There are mainly 4 types of loops:
1-for loop;
2-while loop; 
3-do while loop; 
4-and enhanced for loop.

Why we should learn about loop?
Because loops help us write cleaner and scalable code.
 for example if you have to test password field on a web page  
you can create different variation of data in an excel sheet then you pick
all the values one by one and test the field.
 
 Syntax for loops:
for loop
for(starting point; ending point; step size){
code that we want repeat
}
