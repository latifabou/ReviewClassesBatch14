-->What does a SDET do?
Test the software mostly websites like facebook, amazon etc.
You be checking if all the links on a website work properly; all the dropdown text boxes etc.
-->Why we don't want to test websites manually? Because it is very slow.
--> How computers work?
If we want a computer to solve a problem for us, we need two main things:
1-we need to provide informations about that task;
2-we need to provide instructions on how to use those informations.
Because computers are very good at processing numbers and texts.
we will be using those two forms to provide informations to the computer.
Because, we need to store informations with instructions, we use different types of variables.
--> Types of variables in Java:
There are two main data types in Java: Primitives and non primitives.
Primitives data types are basics, they are used to store informations in a computer program,
they are very efficient in storing the data but sometimes it requires a lot of work to store 
and process informations.
Non primitives data types require more space and easier to work with.
==>what are primitives data types?
They are used to store informations in a computer program.
--> Why i should learn about primitives data types?
Because all others types are built using these primitives. They require minimum memory to store information.
How can I use primitives data types?
1)we need to specify the data type;
2)we need to give a name to the box so we can get it back if we need informations in the future;
3)we can= to store the information.
