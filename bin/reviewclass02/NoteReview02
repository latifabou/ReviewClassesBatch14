Type casting is converting one data type to another.
We have 2 types of type casting:
-Explicit/narrowing/manual:we go from a bigger data type to a smaller.
-implicit/widening/automatic: we go from a smaller data type to a larger.
1)Byte(8 bites);2)short(16),char(16);3)int(32);4)long(64);5)float(32)6)double(64).
byte->short,char->int->long->float->double
Why we need type casting?
When we are working in teams we might need to convert data from different
data types. when we are working with math some time we need to get rid of
decimal part as we are only interested in the non- decimal part.
What is the syntax?
Explicit/narrowing/Manual
int box=1000;
byte box2=(byte) box;
Implicit/widening/Automatic
short box1=250;
int box2=box1;
===========================================================
If statements:
if else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decision 
based on some condition and provided data.
if condition
if else condition
if else if condition
nested if else condition.
why we should learn about if else condition?
when we are solving real life problems
like testing a web site our program needs to make a lot of 
decisions.
What is the syntax of if else conditions?
if condition
boolean rich=true;
if(rich)
{
System.out.println("Lets buy a Jet or Island");
}
